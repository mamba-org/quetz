Front-end
---------

Quetz comes with a initial frontend implementation. It can be found in quetz_frontend.
To build it, one needs to install:

.. code-block:: bash

    mamba install 'nodejs>=14'
    cd quetz_frontend
    npm install
    npm run build
    # for development
    npm run watch

This will build the javascript files and place them in /quetz_frontend/dist/ from
where they are automatically picked up by the quetz server.
